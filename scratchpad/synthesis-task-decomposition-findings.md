# Task Decomposition Implementation Findings
## Executive Summary

Three expert agents analyzed how to implement automatic task decomposition in Perun Flow. Here are the synthesized findings and recommendations.

## Key Consensus Points

### 1. **Hybrid Approach is Best**
All agents agree on a **hybrid LLM + template-based system**:
- Templates for common patterns (fast, reliable)
- LLM for complex decomposition (flexible, intelligent) 
- Smart routing based on task complexity analysis

### 2. **Build on Existing Architecture**
Leverage Perun Flow's strengths:
- ✅ Dual storage system (files + graph DB)
- ✅ Existing subtask support in markdown
- ✅ Semantic ID system for task organization
- ✅ Dependency management infrastructure

### 3. **Incremental Implementation**
4-phase rollout minimizes risk:
1. **Core Infrastructure** (2-3 days)
2. **LLM Integration** (3-4 days) 
3. **Enhanced UX** (2-3 days)
4. **Advanced Features** (3-4 days)

## Recommended Solution

### Architecture Components
```
TaskComplexityAnalyzer → DecompositionEngine → TaskHierarchyManager
                              ↓
                    [Templates] [LLM Service]
                              ↓
                         Enhanced TaskManager
```

### New MCP Tools
- `mcp__tasks__decompose` - Main decomposition tool
- `mcp__tasks__hierarchy` - View parent-child relationships
- Enhanced `mcp__tasks__create` with auto-decomposition option

### Database Extensions
- Add `IS_PARENT_OF` relationship in KuzuDB
- Extend Task nodes with complexity scoring
- Track decomposition metadata

### User Experience
- **Default**: Auto-assess complexity, decompose if needed
- **Preview**: Show proposed subtasks before creating
- **Interactive**: Allow user editing of decomposition
- **Graceful**: Handle failures without disrupting workflow

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 days)
- Add parent-child relationships to database schema
- Extend TaskManager with decomposition methods
- Create LLM service interface (with mocks)
- Update sync engine for hierarchy support

### Phase 2: LLM Integration (3-4 days)
- Implement actual LLM decomposition service
- Add complexity analysis algorithms
- Create task decomposition prompts
- Add error handling and fallbacks

### Phase 3: Enhanced UX (2-3 days)
- Implement `decompose` MCP tool
- Add hierarchy visualization in task files
- Create preview and confirmation flows
- Update `findNextTask` for smart prioritization

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (3-4 days)
- Add template-based decomposition
- Implement batch decomposition
- Add user preference settings
- Performance optimizations and caching

## Key Benefits

1. **Intuitive Workflow**: "Create task → system handles complexity"
2. **Smart Dependencies**: Automatic dependency management
3. **User Control**: Preview and edit before committing
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing tasks continue working
5. **Scalable**: Templates + LLM handles simple → complex cases

## Risk Mitigation

- **Feature flags** for safe rollout
- **Comprehensive testing** at each phase
- **Mock services** for reliable CI/CD
- **Performance limits** to prevent abuse
- **Clear rollback** mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. **Proof of Concept**: Implement Phase 1 in a feature branch
2. **LLM Selection**: Choose model (GPT-4, Claude, local) and test prompts
3. **Template Design**: Create patterns for common task types
4. **User Testing**: Validate UX with real decomposition scenarios
